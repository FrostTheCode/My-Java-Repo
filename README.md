# My-Java-Repo
this a repository of all my old java proyects, maybe someone will used it in the future, IDK maybe you wild find it helpful. (ㆆ _ ㆆ)
all this proyects were made with the IDE Eclipse and then later were
all imported to NetBeans, so if you had any problems with opening this
files, try using this softweres, i open them in VS Code and they run
normally so maybe that could help you | (• ◡•)|
